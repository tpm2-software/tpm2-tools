Introduction:
TPM Tools have a limitation in which the context is flushed between commands
when using a resource manager. The resource manager calls flush when a client
disconnects. Thus, state becomes difficult to manage.

The TPM shell serves to mitigate this limitation. It provides a lua module
that keeps the connection open with the resourcemanager between command
invocations.

Why Lua?
Lua was chosen to provide language semantics and an interpreter an a portable
and standardized manor. Lua is buildable for just about any environment, from
user space to UEFI.

The Lua manual can be found here: https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/

Using:
You must set the LUA_CPATH variable so Lua can find the shared library.

From the root of the project, run:
export LUA_CPATH=`pwd`'/lib?.so'

From there you can run test.lua
