Define NV index with given auth value, if passwd not given, assume NULL
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tpm2_nvdefine
Define NV index with given auth value, if passwd not given, assume NULL
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-x ,\-\-index\fR
specifies the index of the NV area.
.TP
\fB\-a ,\-\-authHandle\fR
specifies the handle used to authorize:  0x40000001 (TPM_RH_OWNER)   0x4000000C (TPM_RH_PLATFORM) 
.TP
\fB\-s ,\-\-size\fR
specifies the size of data area.
.TP
\fB\-t ,\-\-attribute\fR
Specifies the attribute values for the nv region used when creating the entitiy. Either the raw
bitfield mask or "nice-names" may be used. The values can be found in Table 204 Part 2 of the TPM2.0
specification, which can be found here:
.UR
https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-Rev-2.0-Part-2-Structures-01.38.pdf
.UE.

Nice names are calculated by taking the name field of table 204 and removing the prefix TPMA_NV_
and lowercasing the result. Thus, TPMA_NV_PPWRITE becomes ppwrite. Nice names can be joined
using the bitwise or "|" symbol. Note that the TPM_NT is 4 bits wide, and thus can be set via
nt=<num> format. For instance, to set The fields TPMA_NV_OWNERREAD, TPMA_NV_OWNERWRITE,
TPMA_NV_POLICYWRITE, and TPMA_NT = 0x3, the argument would be:
ownerread|ownerwrite|policywrite|nt=0x3
.TP
\fB\-P ,\-\-handlePasswd\fR
specifies the password of authHandle.
.TP
\fB\-I ,\-\-indexPasswd\fR
specifies the password of NV Index when  created. 
.TP
\fB\-X ,\-\-passwdInHex\fR
passwords given by any options are hex format
.TP
\fB\-L ,\-\-policy\-file\fR
Specifies the policy digest file for policy based authorizations.
.TP
\fB\-S ,\-\-input-session-handle\fR
Optional Input session handle from a policy session for authorization.
