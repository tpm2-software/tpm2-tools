.SH NAME
tpm2_verifysignature\ - uses loaded keys to validate a signature on a message with the message digest
passed to the TPM. If the signature check succeeds, then the TPM will produce
a TPMT_TK_VERIFIED. Otherwise, the TPM shall return TPM_RC_SIGNATURE. If
keyHandle references an asymmetric key, only the public portion of the key
needs to be loaded. If keyHandle references a symmetric key, both the public
and private portions need to be loaded.
