.SH NAME
tpm2_certify\ - prove that an object with a specific Name is loaded in the TPM. By certifying
that the object is loaded, the TPM warrants that a public area with a given
Name is self-consistent and associated with a valid sensitive area. If a
relying party has a public area that has the same Name as a Name certified
with this command, then the values in that public area are correct. The object
may be any object that is loaded with TPM2_Load() or TPM2_CreatePrimary().
An object that only has its public area loaded cannot be certified.
