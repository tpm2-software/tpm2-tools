returns the data in a loaded Sealed Data Object.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tpm2_unseal
returns the data in a loaded Sealed Data Object.

The \-\-set-list and \-\-pcr-input-file options should only be used for simple PCR authentication policies. For more complex policies the tools should be ran in an execution environment that keeps the session context alive and pass that session using the \-\-input-session-handle option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-H ,\-\-item\fR
item handle, handle of a loaded data object
.TP
\fB\-c ,\-\-itemContext\fR
filename for item context
.TP
\fB\-P ,\-\-pwdi\fR
item handle password, optional
.TP
\fB\-o ,\-\-outfile\fR
Output file name, containing the unsealed data. Defaults to stdout if not specified.
.TP
\fB\-X ,\-\-passwdInHex\fR

.TP
\fB\-S ,\-\-input-session-handle\fR
Optional Input session handle from a policy session for authorization.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR,\ \fB\-\-set-list\fR
The list of pcr banks and selected PCRs' ids (0~23) for each bank.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR,\ \fB\-\-pcr-input-file\fR
Optional Path or Name of the file containing expected pcr values for the specified index. Default is to read the current PCRs per the set list.
