.SH NAME
tpm2_sign\ - sign an externally provided hash with the specified symmetric or asymmetric
signing key. If keyHandle references a restricted signing key, then validation
shall be provided, indicating that the TPM performed the hash of the data and
validation shall indicate that hashed data did not start with
TPM_GENERATED_VALUE. The scheme of keyHandle should not be TPM_ALG_NULL.
