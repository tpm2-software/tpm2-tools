## Changelog

### 5.2 2021-09-28
### 5.2-rc0 2021-09-01

* tpm2_nvextend:

  * Added option -n, --name to specify the name of the nvindex in hex bytes.
    This is used when cpHash ought to be calculated without dispatching the
    TPM2_NV_Extend command to the TPM.

* tpm2_nvread:

  * Added option **\--rphash**=_FILE_ to specify ile path to record the hash
    of the response parameters. This is commonly termed as rpHash.
  * Added option **\-n**, **\--name** to specify the name of the nvindex in
    hex bytes. This is used when cpHash ought to be calculated without
    dispatching the TPM2_NVRead command to the TPM.
  * Added option **-S**, **\--session** to specify to specify an auxiliary
    session for auditing and or encryption/decryption of the parameters.

* tpm2_nvsetbits:

  * Added option **\--rphash**=_FILE_ to specify file path to record the hash
    of the response parameters. This is commonly termed as rpHash.
  * Added option **-S**, **\--session** to specify to specify an auxiliary
    session for auditing and or encryption/decryption of the parameters.
  * Added option **\-n**, **\--name** to specify the name of the nvindex in
    hex bytes. This is used when cpHash ought to be calculated without
    dispatching the TPM2_NV_SetBits command to the TPM.

* tpm2_createprimary:

  * Support public-key output at creation time in various public-key formats.

* tpm2_create:

  * Support public-key output at creation time in various public-key formats.

* tpm2_print:

  * Support outputing public key in various public key formats over the default
    YAML output. Supports taking `-u` output from `tpm2_create` and converting
    it to a PEM or DER file format.

* tpm2_import:

  * Add support for importing keys with sealed-data-blobs.

* tpm2_rsaencrypt, tpm2_rsadecrypt:

  * Add support for specifying the hash algorithm with oaep.

* tpm2_pcrread, tpm2_quote:

  * Add option **-F**, **\--pcrs_format** to specify PCR format selection for
    the binary blob in the PCR output file. 'values' will output a binary blob
    of the PCR values. 'serialized' will output a binary blob of the PCR
    values in the form of serialized data structure in little endian format.

* tpm2_eventlog:

  * Add support for decoding StartupLocality.
  * Add support for printing the partition information.
  * Add support for reading eventlogs longer than 64kb including from
    /sys/kernel/security/tpm0/binary_bios-measurements.

* tpm2_duplicate:

  * Add option **-L**, **\--policy** to specify an authorization policy to be
    associated with the duplicated object.
  * Added support for external key duplication without needing the TCTI.

* tools:

  * Enhance error message on invalid passwords when sessions cannot be used.

* lib/tpm2_options:

  * Add option to specify fake tcti which is required in cases where sapi ctx
    is required to be initialized for retrieving command parameters without
    invoking the tcti to talk to the TPM.

* openssl:

  * Dropped support for OpenSSL < 1.1.0
  * Add support for OpenSSL 3.0.0

* Support added to make the repository documentation and man pages available
  live on readthedocs.

* Bug-fixes:

  * tpm2_import: Don't allow setting passwords for imported object with -p
    option as the tool doesn't modify the TPM2B_SENSITIVE structure. Added
    appropriate logging to indicate using **tpm2_changeauth** after import.

  * lib/tpm2_util.c: The function to calculate pHash algorithm returned error
    when input session is a password session and the only session in the command.

  * lib/tpm2_alg_util.c: Fix an error where oaep was parsed under ECC.

  * tpm2_sign: Fix segfaults when tool does not find TPM resources (TPM or RM).

  * tpm2_makecredential: Fix an issue where reading input from stdin could
    result in unsupported data size larger than the largest digest size.

  * tpm2_loadexternal: Fix an issue where restricted attribute could not be set.

  * lib/tpm2_nv_util.h: The NV index size is dependent on different data sets
    read from the GetCapability structures because there is a dependency on the
    NV operation type: Define vs Read vs Write vs Extend. Fix a sane default in
    the case where GetCapability fails or fails to report the specific property/
    data set. This is especially true because some properties are TPM
    implementation dependent.

  * tpm2_createpolicy: Fix an issue where tool exited silently without reporting
    an error if wrong pcr string is specified.

  * lib/tpm2_alg_util: add error message on public init to prevent tools from
    dying silently, add an error message.

  * tpm2_import: fix an issue where an imported hmac object scheme was NULL.
    While allowed, it was inconsistent with other tools like tpm2_create which
    set the scheme as hmac->sha256 when generating a keyedhash object.

### 5.1.1 2021-06-21

  * tpm2_import: fix fixed AES key CVE-2021-3565
      - tpm2_import used a fixed AES key for the inner wrapper, which means that
        a MITM attack would be able to unwrap the imported key. To fix this,
        ensure the key size is 16 bytes or bigger and use OpenSSL to generate a
        secure random AES key.

### 5.0 - 2020-11-16

#### Non Backwards Compatible Changes

  * Default hash algorithm is now sha256. Prior versions claimed sha1, but were
    inconsistent in choice. Best practice is to specify the hash algorithm to
    avoid suprises.
   
  * tpm2_tools and tss2_tools are now a busybox style commandlet. Ie
    tpm2\_getrandom becomes tpm2 getrandom. make install will install symlinks
    to the old tool names and the tpm2 commandlet will interogate argv[0] for
    the command to run. This will provide backwards compatibility if they are
    installed. If you wish to use the old names not installed system wide, set
    DESTDIR during install to a seperate path and set the proper directory on
    PATH.

  * tpm2\_eventlog's output changed to be YAML compliant. The output before
    was intended to be YAML compliant but was never properly checked and tested.

  * umask set to 0117 for all tools.

  * tpm2\_getekcertificate now outputs the INTC EK certificates in PEM format
    by default. In order to output the URL safe variant of base64 encoded
    output of the INTC EK certificate use the added option **--raw**.

#### Dependency update

  * Update tpm2-tss dependency version to
    [3.0.1](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/releases/tag/3.0.1)

  * Update tpm2-abrmd dependency version to

      PEM format using the new option **-G**, **--key-algorithm**. Can specify
      either RSA/ECC. When this option is used, input public key is expected to

#### Bug fixes

  * Fix printing short options when no ascii character is used.

    will become deprecated (DEPRECATED_1_2_0).
